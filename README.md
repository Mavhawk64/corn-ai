# Agro-Ai
The AI can determine if a corn leaf is infected with Northern Corn Leaf Blight. The frontend contains 2 pages that interact with the AI. The View page can be used to scroll through images that the AI has processed. The training page can be played like a game, where a user can choose whether a corn leaf image is sick or not. After a choice has been made, the user will be shown what the AI thinks.
